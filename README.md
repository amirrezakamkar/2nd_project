# Vanguard - Experiment Data Analysis

This repository is part of a group project to provide performance metrics and key findings. Our mission is to uncover the results of an exciting digital experiment that the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard launched. Vanguard is an US-based investment management company

## Business Case

Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. Therefore, they conducted the following experiment: 

## Experiment

An A/B test was set into motion from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 by the CX team.

- **Control Group** Clients interacted with the traditional online process.
- **Test Group** Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.

Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

## Data Sources

This project leverages 4 datasets from the company. The key data sources include:

1. **Client profiles** – Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.
2. **Digital footprints** – A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts.
3. **Experiment roster** – A list revealing which clients were part of the grand experiment.


## Project Overview

The process of this project consists of:

1. **EDA and data Cleaning** – Datasets exploration and client behaviour analysis. 
2. **Performance Metrics** - Success indicators and redesign outcome.
3. **Hypothesis Testing** - Completion rate and completion Rate with a Cost-Effectiveness Threshold.
4. **Experiment Evaluation** - Design Effectiveness, duration Assessment and additional Data Needs.
5. **Figures in Tableau** - Insightful and interactive visualizations.
6. **Analysis and Correlation** – Exploring the relationships between the total time that customers spent in the whole process and other factors related to the clients (Tenure in years, Gender, Number of accounts, Age, Amount of balance, Calls in 6 months and the Test/Control group). 

### Tools and Resources

- **Jupyter Lab**: A powerful open-source tool for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: The primary language used for data processing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Tableau**: An interactive data visualization software focused on business intelligence (BI).
